Python Programming Round (Score : 10)
1. Develop a Python Application that will help users track their expenses and
savings goals.
Requirements
● Users can log their daily expenses
● Expenses are categorized (e.g., "Food," "Transport," "Entertainment").
● Users can set monthly budgets for each category.
● The system alerts users if they exceed their budget for the category.

Basic Reports

● Show Total spending per month
● Compare spending vs budget per category
If all this seems too easy, extra credit will be given for:
● Allowing users to have different budgets for different months
● Custom alerts, example: alert user when only 10% budget is left
● Email notifications to user for alert
● Allowing users to share expenses, amongst a group (think Splitwise)
The public github link to be shared by the candidate to their corresponding placement
coordinator for review from our end.

(1)
- SQL Query or ORM abstraction Implementation (1)
- Documentation in the code (1)
- Docker based build and run and commands updated on ReadMe file (1)

General Guidelines
- Share your personal public github repository which contains the above problem
statement with the placement coordinator
- Evaluators would simply clone the above repo and follow the instructions in
ReadMe to see the output of the application
- Focus on python coding standards in the backend
- Don’t spend a lot of time on CSS and front-end development
- Focus on handling edge scenarios and document the same on the ReadMe for
the evaluators to validate and score as well
